# Work-Day-Schedule
REFACTORING A CALENDAR SCHEDULE

This project was part of a refactoring code. We were given the index.html, script.js, and style.css. The refactoring was mostly focused on the index.html and the script.js.
We were given an 'acceptance criteria' to fullfill for this project. Below is my guidelines for the 'acceptance criteria'.

CHALLENGES

Coding in JavaScript continues to be very hard for me. Still have to rely on notes from my classes, class activites, lots of online tutorials, and website tutorials (such as mozilla and W3schools).
Still very weak when using JavaScript. Takes a very long time just to even get 5 lines of code. This project was still a challenge, but I did like using jQuery. For example, I like using the '.on' for the click, instead of eventListner. To me I understand it, probably because it is short and simple and less words. And using $(this), is very convenient.
I continue to struggle on where to start coding, even though I have written pseudo-code for myself. Something I still need to work on.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down

THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day

THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a timeblock

THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page

THEN the saved events persist
